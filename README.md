# ICS4U - CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization

Edit this page to include:
* A description of the data set you are using
* The data set that I am using is from Our World in Data and it is about the Human Development Index (HDI). The Human Development Index measures key components of human development which include life expectancy, access to education, and standard of living. Based on these components, the United Nations gives a rating to countries all over the globe. In my data set, there are four columns which are the name of the country, the continent that the country resides in, the year, and the HDI score. I am analyzing 147 countries in three different years: 1997, 2007, and 2017. There are 441 data records and I will be analyzing the trends from this data set.

* Why you selected this data set for this project.
* I selected this data set for the project because I wanted to see if I could create a program that not only allows the user to view the data set, but to also be able to view trends and make comparisons. I first learned about the Human Development Index when studying grade 12 economics (CIA4U1) and I am interested to see if the HDI has improved globally and specifically in Canada. Overall, I believe that this data is not only interesting, but also displays the conditions of various countries and the world.
